This program teaches a Minecraft agent to explore and survive in a contained but hostile environment. The environment is maze-like, containing multiple passages leading in all directions. The agent learns to move through the environment, collecting diamonds, but avoiding enemy Zombies that can knock the agent off into the lava.

Essentially, this program teaches an agent to play Pacman.

The agent will be taught using various different local search algorithms, and we will then compare the performance of each algorithm. So far, the agent can learn to navigate its environment using either a [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) or a [hillclimbing algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing). You can see a video of the program in action below.

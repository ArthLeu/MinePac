## Summary

This project will teach an agent to explore and survive a contained but hostile environment. The agent will be able omniscient, knowing the contents of every voxel in the environment, but will have to learn to succed in the environment using genetic, hill-climbing, and other local search algorithms. These algorithms will take the world state as input, and output a list of movement commands designed to maximize the agent's exploration and survival. By comparing the success of these algorithms, this project will provide an empirical measure of their suitability for tasks in this domain.

## Algorithms

This project will deploy and compare genetic, hill-climbing, and other local search algorithms.
